# Kilvolt Blog, Thursday

**Author**: Travis Williams
**Version**: 2.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
A blog project, mostly intended as a cool and convenient way of learning jQuery.  Also, a humbling reminder of the fact that I'm often immensely stupid.  Problem domain is to dynamically render blog articles to the page from a blog object, and dynamically show/hide content based on if read-more/read-less is clicked, as well as Home/About in the nav bar.

## Getting Started
If you found this, it means you know where it lives on github.  Go ahead and fork.

## Architecture
jQuery.  
Also, tears and caffeine.

## Change Log
Probably should have done this.  Didn't.
